## üè• Project Name: **Swasth-AI**

### *(Voice-First Multilingual Health Assistant for Rural India)*

---

## üåç Problem

Healthcare access in rural India faces three main barriers:

* **Connectivity Gaps:** Many regions lack reliable internet access.
* **Language Barriers:** Most healthcare resources exist only in English or Hindi.
* **Limited Medical Guidance:** People often ignore early symptoms or don‚Äôt know what to do in emergencies like snake bites or burns.

---

## üí° Solution

**Arogya Sahayak** is a **voice-first multilingual AI healthcare assistant** that works **offline and online** ‚Äî bringing medical guidance to every rural user‚Äôs phone.

* **Offline:** Voice-based interaction, local language understanding, emergency video guides.
* **Online:** Vision-based AI for analyzing reports and images, advanced medical reasoning, and cloud-assisted symptom checking.

The app acts as a **digital frontline health helper**, not replacing doctors but helping users understand when professional consultation is necessary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core User Flow

1. **Login / Setup:**
   Simple OTP-based login or offline local user profile creation.

2. **Voice Interaction (Offline or Online):**

   * User taps the mic button and speaks in their **local language** (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, etc.).
   * Offline speech model converts the speech to text.
   * AI asks a few follow-up questions to narrow down possible causes.
   * Provides a **spoken and visual response** ‚Äî simple, actionable advice.

3. **Vision-Based Medical Analysis (Online):**

   * ü©∏ Upload **blood report** ‚Üí AI reads values (OCR) and highlights potential issues.
   * ü©ª Upload **X-ray image** ‚Üí Cloud model detects abnormalities.
   * üî• Upload **skin/burn images** ‚Üí Vision model gives infection or burn severity rating and first-aid advice.

4. **Offline Health Education Library:**

   * Pre-downloaded **video guides** available in local languages.
   * Topics:

     * What to do in a **snake bite** üêç
     * How to perform **CPR** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
     * **Stop bleeding**, **handle burns**, or **treat fever** at home
   * Helps users handle emergencies safely even without internet access.

5. **Online Doctor Connect (Optional):**

   * If AI detects serious health conditions, it suggests or connects the user to nearby clinics or telemedicine options.
